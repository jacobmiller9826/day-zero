# Generative Phoenix Collapse - Day Zero

This is a **generative, animated web experience** portraying the early moments of a water crisis in Phoenix, Arizona, where 5 million people face the sudden collapse of their water supply.

## Features

- Procedurally generated desert landscape with sand dunes and mountains
- Randomly placed and animated cacti that sway gently in the heat
- Animated sun moving across the sky to simulate time passing
- Flickering distant city lights to evoke a tense, uncertain atmosphere
- Dynamic heat haze effects to enhance the desert heat feeling
- Cyclic narration text telling a haunting story of the crisis onset
- Fully responsive and retina-ready for desktop and mobile
- Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Canvas API) — no external assets or libraries

## Usage

1. Save the provided `index.html` file to your local machine or web server.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
3. Watch the endless generative animation and narration cycle.
4. Embed or extend the code for your own storytelling or educational projects.

## How It Works

- Uses Perlin noise for natural-looking dune movement and heat haze flickering
- Draws all graphics dynamically on the HTML5 Canvas element
- Uses a simple animation loop with `requestAnimationFrame`
- Narration text fades in and out every 12 seconds to guide the story mood

## Potential Extensions

- Add interactive story choices or branching narratives
- Introduce characters or fleeing crowds animated on the canvas
- Integrate real climate or water data for educational purposes
- Build out subsequent scenes with escalating events and consequences
